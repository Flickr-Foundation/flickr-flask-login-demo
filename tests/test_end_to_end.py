This does an end-to-end test of the login flow in the entire app.

In particular:

1.  Start with a logged-out user
2.  Check they cannot see logged-in pages
3.  Have them go to ``/authorize`` and pretend they go to Flickr.com
    to complete the log in and approve the app
4.  Simulate them returning to ``/callback`` and being logged in
5.  Check they can now see logged-in pages
6.  Check they can log out again
7.  Check they can no longer see logged-in pages

    Do an end-to-end test of our login flow.

    I had to use real OAuth credentials to set up this test.

    What I did:

    1.  Ran the first half of the test, up to the commented-out ``assert 0``.
        This gave me a real authorization URL I could open in Flickr.

    2.  I clicked that authorization URL, which took me to a localhost/â€¦
        URL.  I pasted that into the callback_resp line, and matched the state
        to the session cookie.

    3.  I ran the entire test, with the ``assert 0`` commented out.  This did
        the token exchange with Flickr.

    4.  I redacted the secrets from the URL and the VCR cassette.
